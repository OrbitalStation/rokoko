//!
//! This module provides a powerful `new` function to vec.
//!
//! Basically, everything here is directed for inner usage.
//!
//! However, I know how painful it is when something in library is
//! not `pub` because developer thought it won't be useful for users,
//! but you actually would be more than happy to use it.
//!
//! So, just in case, I'll leave this all `pub`.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```nightly
//! use rokoko::prelude::*;
//!
//! // Basic form
//! assert_eq!(ivec3::new(1, 2, 3), ivec3::from([1, 2, 3]));
//!
//! // Defaults
//! assert_eq!(ivec3::new(7, 8), ivec3::from([7, 8, 0]));
//!
//! // Vecs can be used in arguments
//! let v1 = bvec2::new(true, false);
//! assert_eq!(bvec3::new(v1, false), bvec3::new(true, false, false));
//!
//! let position = fvec3::new(0.0, -0.5);
//! assert_eq!(fvec4::new(position, 1.0), fvec4::new(0.0, -0.5, 0.0, 1.0));
//!
//! // Lists too
//! assert_eq!(dvec4::new(27.27, [0.0], [[-1.17]], [[[3.0]], []]), dvec4::new(27.27, 0.0, -1.17, 3.0));
//!
//! // And even tuples(up to 10 elements)!
//! assert_eq!(fvec3::new(0.1, (), ((), ()), (13.21, (((), ()))), f32::MIN), fvec3::new(0.1, 13.21, f32::MIN));
//! ```

/// A type implementing `Piece <T>` could be used as an argument in `new`.
///
/// Well, now expanded.
///
/// # How the `new` works
///
/// The main wish was that `vec` should have some constructor,
/// that would accept different arguments and would create a vec from all of them.
///
/// But... How?
///
/// Firstly, I needed to decide how such a constructor
/// (by the way at the time name `new` had already appeared)
/// would take different amount of args, such as `(1, 2)` and `([1, 8], 3)`.
///
/// Secondly, there should be filling non-specified arguments with default values.
///
/// After reading some docs I found out these lovely traits: `Fn`, `FnMut` and `FnOnce`.
///
/// The idea is that `new` is *not* actually a function, but a const unit struct, which implements
/// one of `Fn*` traits(from family of `Fn*` traits I have chosen `Fn` - the most simple one)
/// multiple times or something like that and thus can accept different args.
///
/// After long period of thinking I've decided that there should be
/// no multiple implementations of `Fn`, but a single one -
/// all the generic stuff is now here -> in `Piece`.
///
/// Arguments in `Fn` are given packed in tuple, so another idea appeared -
/// what if tuple is also a `Piece`, and `Piece` is also a recursive trait?
///
/// Unfortunately, Rust does not (*yet*) support trait impls for tuples as a whole,
/// so I decided that `new` taking, let's say, 10 parameters is enough.
///
/// Now it works as follows:
///
/// You call `fvec3::new(1.0, 2)`.
///
/// The packed args `(1.0f64, 2i32)` are given to `new`.
///
/// Tuple `(f64, i32)` implements `Piece` as 2 <= 10
///     and both `f64` and `i32` are convertible to `f32`,
///     so that we can continue.
///
/// Uninit vec of 3 elements is created.
///
/// 2(number of given args) < 3(len of vec), so the last value is filled
///     with a default one (`0.0f32` in this case).
///
/// `embed` on args is called.
///
/// `embed` on `1.0f64` is called:
/// - `1.0f64` gets converted into `1.0f32`
/// - `1.0f32` is placed into the first slot of a future vec.
///
/// `embed` on `2i32` is called:
/// - `2i32` gets converted into `2.0f32`
/// - `2.0f32` is placed into the second slot of a future vec.
///
/// Voila! Our `vec` is now ready and smells tasty, filled with
/// `[1.0f32, 2.0f32, 0.0f32]`.
